# Dataset matchings
This directory contains matchings between the lfm-1b dataset (http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/) and the Million Song and Free Music Archive datasets.

The lfm-1b/MSD matching also has a separate repo: https://github.com/devinplatt/lfm-1b-msd-matching

The matchings work on a line-by-line basis: files with the same number of lines as "matched_artists_tracks.txt" link data by their line number. Longer files simply list all of the identifiers for items in a dataset which were matched.
